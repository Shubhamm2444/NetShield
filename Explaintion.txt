Project Overview
The Basic Java Firewall Simulation is a Java application designed to simulate basic firewall functionality. It listens for incoming network connections, evaluates them based on predefined rules, and allows or blocks access accordingly. While it does not interact with system-level firewalls (like iptables), it demonstrates key concepts of networking and security.

Key Components
ServerSocket:
The program uses ServerSocket to listen for incoming connections on a specified port (default is 8080).
This socket acts as the entry point for client connections.

  Connection Handling:
When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and retrieves the client’s IP address.
It checks whether the IP address is allowed based on rules defined in the configuration.

  IP Filtering:
The isAllowed method determines if a client’s IP address is in the allowed list (loaded from a configuration file).
This allows for simple whitelisting of IP addresses.

  Rate Limiting:
The application keeps track of the number of connections from each IP address.
If a specific IP exceeds a predefined limit (e.g., 5 connections), further connections are blocked to prevent abuse.

  HTTP Response:
For allowed connections, the server simulates a basic HTTP response, sending a "Hello, World!" message.
This demonstrates handling of HTTP requests, although the focus is on connection management.

  Logging:
All connection attempts, whether allowed or blocked, are logged to a file (firewall.log).
This provides a history of events for monitoring and debugging purposes.

  Configuration Management:
The project uses a properties file (config.properties) to manage allowed IP addresses dynamically.
This makes it easier to adjust settings without modifying the source code.

  Use Cases
Educational Tool: This project serves as a learning tool for understanding basic networking concepts and firewall principles.
Prototyping: Developers can use it as a prototype to build more complex security applications or enhance firewall features.
Testing: It can be used to simulate network environments for testing security configurations and behaviors.

  Potential Enhancements
Dynamic IP Management: Allow users to add or remove allowed IPs at runtime.
More Protocols: Extend support for other protocols beyond HTTP, such as FTP or custom TCP/UDP applications.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement a GUI to visualize connections and log entries for easier management.
Advanced Security Features: Incorporate additional security measures like encryption, logging levels, or alerts for suspicious activities.

  Conclusion
The Basic Java Firewall Simulation project effectively demonstrates fundamental concepts in networking and security. It’s a practical exercise that showcases how to manage incoming connections, enforce security rules, and log activities, all within a simple Java application framework. This can serve as a foundation for more complex security solutions in the future.
